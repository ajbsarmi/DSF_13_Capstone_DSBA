# Capstone_DSBA
The Data Science Bootcamp was designed with the goal of creating a bot that assists students during the sprints by answering their questions and clarifying any confusing topics. Additionally, the bot will provide learners with relevant links to enhance their understanding and support their learning throughout the bootcamp.
